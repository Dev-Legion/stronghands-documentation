What is Stronghands?
Stronghands is a community-driven organization built to solve what might be called
the "liquidity problem." One could define this problem as the inability of
disparate forms of liquidity to connect with markets in a decentralized way,
and vice versa. While other solutions provide incrementally progressive
advances toward solving the problem of liquidity, Stronghands's progress is intended
to create a broader range of network effects. Rather than limiting itself to a
single solution, Stronghands intertwines many decentralized markets and instruments.

Thus far, the core products, which will be described in more detail here,
include: a decentralized exchange, a decentralized lending market, yield
instruments, an auction platform, an AMM framework and staking derivatives.
Stronghands's products are configured in a way that allows the entire platform to
maintain decentralized governance of $SUSHI token holders, while continuing to
innovate on the collective foundations by design. Whereas major structural
changes are voted on by the community, the day-to-day operations, rebalancing
of pools and ratios, business strategy and overall development is ultimately
decided on by our core team.

The following documentation details the functional and technical aspects of
the ecosystem products, as well as customized tutorials to walk you through
all of Stronghands's exciting features!
