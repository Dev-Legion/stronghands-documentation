What is Stronghands?

ISHND is the finance utility token of StrongHands BlockChain Ecosystem. 
It was designed to be a turning point on DeFi, bringing 1st generation coins into the ecosystem, 
collateralizing with tokens available in StrongHands Finance Swap Platform. 
It will offer many dApps and low fees to diversify investment in the decentralized economy.

ISHND will have an important role balancing the whole ecosystem and 
creating liquidity for all projects listed. 
Also, it provides rewards and passive income in different coins and tokens.

Platform is being architected to become faster and clearer for users, 
paying fair APR staking and farming iSHND, as well as other tokens. 
The differential concept already established is meant to be the turning point 
of our project: the CrossChain/ MultiChain platform, which will allow users to switch 
chains whenever they like from BNB Chain to ETH, TRX, SOL, Polygon and others.
The achievement of such a possibility is to integrate iSHND and turn it 
into a agile and reliable tool, avoiding common issues like blockchain congestion and high gas pricing.
